# airpark-android
Android app code for the airpark app

## Setup

### If you want to have a look at the code
Clone the project or download it. Open it using Android Studio and press the run button (The green play icon on the IDE). We don't recommend this since the Emulator for Android studio is pretty slow and laggy and doesn't show some UI elements like toast messages.

### Demo the application
Download the apk from the link below and install it on the connected Android Device. You may have allow "install from unsupported sources" in the settings to make it work!
